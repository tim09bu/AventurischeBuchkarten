# Aventurische Buchkarten
This module will give you the ability to use DSA books with Foundry VTT which are based on **[Aventurische Bibliothek](https://www.ulisses-ebooks.de/product/352382/DSA5--Aventurische-Bibliothek-PDF-als-Download-kaufen)**.

## Howto use

If your roll playing groupe is in love with much inGame learing as possible, this module ist what you need. In difference to the origin Aventurische Bibliothek we provide additional content to each book based on the origin published by Ulisses. For example your character can find skills like [*Anatomie*](https://www.ulisses-regelwiki.de/SF_Anatomie_Spezies.html) within a book or secrets like how to make [*Schokolade*](https://ulisses-regelwiki.de/SF_Berufsgeheimnisse.html).
In general we tryed to put all matching DSA 5 rules we found in a book if we think it is matching. New players will get an idea what to learn at the right point without reading all the extra rule sources.

## Rules
In general we have the rule of thump to say: *Each AP needs one QS to be learned. An you get one probe every two hours of reading! Learning special skills you need to collect QS with skills are required. The time to learn is reduced with a teacher by a half of hour for each level of being a teacher. Teacher can only help if their skill level is higher.*
